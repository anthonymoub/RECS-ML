# Abstract

The United States’ energy landscape has undergone significant changes over the years, driven by advancements in technology and evolving consumer habits. Amidst these shifts, understanding and predicting household energy consumption become crucial for policymakers and energy providers to promote sustainability and optimize resource allocation.

In this project, we delve into the vast repository of data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS). By leveraging the power of machine learning and regression-based models, we aim to develop accurate predictors for annual energy consumption in households across the nation.

RECS, conducted since 1978, captures detailed information on homes’ characteristics, appliance usage, number of residents, and demographic insights.
